# Overview
We benchmarked 11 different network inference algorithms on 7 scRNA-seq datasets from three species, yeast, human and mouse. Here we describe the workflow for running the algorithms through one of our datasets, Gasch. All datasets and gold standards are available [here].(https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5907528)
